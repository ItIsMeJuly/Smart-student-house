# Smart-student-house
An arduino project for a smart student house. It consists of 5 arduino subsystems and two Windows Forms applications to monitor the information from the boards. 
They communicate with a serial connection (USB) and the boards send information to the Laptop/PC. It is a group project where my part is the vending machine and microwave.
